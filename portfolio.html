                            <p>This website is in fact a project! Pretty sure that counts.  I've had websites before, but 
                                I tried to do it a little differently this time.  First time around was pure HTML and CSS, but 
                                I wasn't satisfied enough with how it looked to keep it, looked a little too ameteurish. Next 
                                was in wordpress, which felt like cheating but eh, it worked for a while.  Once I decided to try
                                and learn more Front-End, WHAT YOU SEE WAS BORN!  
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>I'm still not 100% satisfied with how it looks,
                                but this time I did more research on some styling techniques, and I think its much better for it.
                                Additionally I took my time a bit more in dealing with positioning and styling.  I feel like I have
                                a much better grasp of how relative positioning works, and how to write good, reusable CSS classes.
                                I'm sure I'll keep making changes here over time, but for now I'm satisfied with it as a portfolio
                                site.

                            <p>Speckle is where I'm currently working.  We're working to create platform to help people learn public 
                                speaking. Rather than just teaching people how to speak though, we're doing things differently by helping
                                people help each other.  The system revolves around people recoring themselves, getting an automatic rating 
                                from us, but also encouraging them to share their videos to others, and have them rate each other, and follow
                                each other to progress as a group.

                                As for my own contribution, I bounced between working on backend infrastructure with AWS, and workign with
                                frontend web portals.  I spent a lot of time working on our DynamoDB tables and related API, allowing for 
                                proper manipulation.  Also created plenty of lambda functions for data maniuplation as well as basic searching,
                                using it for features like getting most viewed videos, featured videos, and featured creators.  This basic search 
                                functionality was temporary before I got our elasticsearch implementation going, with queries to get related information.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Frontend work has so far has been less of a priority for me, but I did create web portals to give data manipulation
                                abilities to our non-technical workers. Prior to this if they wanted to upload videos for testing, they would have to
                                go through us, to have us put it into the table manually. Now the page allows for video uploads and uses Javascript
                                to query lambda functions and upload through there.

                                In addition to my work coding, I've had the unique opportunity to participate in product development, and weigh in
                                on design decisions.  We have a weekly functionality meeting to decide our current priorities and the details of our
                                implementation, and there I've been able to.

                            <p>Dynamic Scheduler is a course project made by me and Cameron Stowell for out IOS programming class.  The core idea
                                is to first take in a person's usual schedule, what activities do they do every week that don't move. Class, work, etc.
                                That they only have to do once. Afterward each week, the user can input any new task, along with their estimated time, and
                                the app will automaticlaly place that task within your new schedule according to your availability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This was definitely a fun project to do, because it was my first taste of product development, and maybe gave me an inkling
                                into it being something I would like to pursue even before my time at Speckle really drove that idea home.  We started with a 
                                few days of heavy duty design work, elaborating on features, visuals, as well as trimming features based on our time table.  
                                We had originally wanted have google calendar integration, but that got dropped on the cutting room floor so to speak.  In hindsight 
                                im weirdly just as proud of what we decided to cut as what made it in.  We ended up with a presentable app just shy of the deadline, 
                                so I'm able to say we made the right call with the cuts, even if they weren't fun decisions to make.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After the design phase, we split the work based on what we were moth comfortable with.  Cameron took care of the specific calendar logic,
                                while I handled most of the app specific needs.  This meant understanding and integrating Cameron's calendar work with IOS data storage and
                                persistence, UI creation and integration, and development of the apps storyboard and app page specific features.

                                I was incredibly lucky to work at Internet Initiative Japan's Innovation Institute during my year abroad.  I was in a course discussing
                                the inner workings of the standard internet protocol stack, which just so happened to be taught by Romaine Fontugne, the leader of IIJ's
                                Internet Health Report project.  From the connection there, I was invited to work part time for a whole nine months with direct contributions
                                the the projects performance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The goal of Internet Health Report is to provide a better understanding about the global internet infrastructure, and how changes in one area can affect
                                connection times elsewhere. The prime example that we usually used to explain is a sudden 50 millisecond increase in traceroute times between Melbourne and
                                singapore in 2018.  This delay directly coincided with submarine cable cut, and the delay was resolved when the cable was replaced.  With this kind of 
                                information, governing bodies or internet service providers can better understand the consequences of changes to infrastructure that may have otherwise been unclear.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My work on the project involved intake, use, and reliability of data.  The system ingests massive amounts of data from the RIPE network coordination centre, which 
                                has physical infrastructure in place to take traceroutes at regular intervals all around the globe.  My job was to take that data, and feed reliably feed it to the different 
                                parts of Internet Health Report, like Tartiflette and Raclette.  To do so, I merged their existing intake methods with a new Kafka architecture.  The script and setup would download
                                the RIPE data, publish it through the Kafka system, and that system would track which different subscribers had or had not processed certain chunks of data. That way, in the event of 
                                an outage, procesing can continue from the logged stop point.  If you want to check out the specifics, the repository is <a href="https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/kafka-migration">here</a>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                My advance wars project was something I made back in the summer between high school and college.  I felt like it was proabably
                                a good idea to start taking on "big boy projects" instead of just basic school work like "checking account systems".  I didn't 
                                realize at the time that by the end I would consider what I had done not particularly relevant for my skillset. Even FURTHER I didn't 
                                realize I'd change my mind back a few years later. Now that I've made that as confusing as humanly possible, I'll try to explain what i mean
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The actual "coding" for the romhack didn't involve any higher level language, or really and language at all. What it did involve was a massive
                                block of hexadecimal values.  The only way to change the game was to manually change some of those individual values, based on their corresponding effect
                                in-game.  Luckily, theres a strong community at warsworldnews.com who did some of the heavy lifting on finding some of the key values.  Since my main focus
                                was creating new levels, the key values for me were the pointers that the campaign looked at to load level data.  That can be shifted to point to the dummy
                                data at the end of the file that doesn't have any affect, and can be replaced with values that represent an entirely different level.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At the time after finishing my goal of making new levels for the first chapter of the campaign, I felt a little unsatisfied, because I hadn't really created
                                anything or used process that involved coding. What I realized upon formally learning about pointers though, is that that entire process was firsthand experience 
                                with pointer manipulation, and I know my understanding of pointers came much faster with the experience.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Lastly, an important, though rather unfortunate learning outcome was how essential good version control is.  At the time, all I was using was copies of edited roms with 
                                titles like "chapter 3 done" and "current working" to keep track of changes. What ended up happening though, is that somewhere along the line I messed up one of my pointer values, 
                                and when the game tries to load that value it crashes (and makes some very scary noises...).  The crucial part though, Is that I didn't notice WHEN that pointer error happened.
                                Up to this point, I had a save file that was on the current working level to gauge progress of course, but that meant I wasn't testing every level I had finished already before moving 
                                on. (In my defense, I still had to play every level all the way through rather than just skip to see if theyre working, which is pretty time consuming...) Thus I ended up in a situation where 
                                I have several different files, each of them having SOME of the levels working and loading properly, but none of them having all.  At the time, thining the project wasn't helpful, I abandoned 
                                it there.  Looking back on it I of course regret that, I no longer have a copy of my hexadecimal editor bookmarks, and it would be pretty difficult to find my level locations without it, so its not 
                                exactly an easy fix.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While its kind of a mega bummer, that means I don't have much to share.  On my github, <a href="https://github.com/electavire/Advance_Wars_Hack">I have some of those old files,</a> so maybe I'll go back at some point. In the mean time though, I have 
                                some pictures of the finished levels, so once I figure out a good layout I'll post some.
