                            <p>This website is in fact a project! Pretty sure that counts.  I've had websites before, but 
                                I tried to do it a little differently this time.  First time around was pure HTML and CSS, but 
                                I wasn't satisfied enough with how it looked to keep it, looked a little too ameteurish. Next 
                                was in wordpress, which felt like cheating but eh, it worked for a while.  Once I decided to try
                                and learn more Front-End, WHAT YOU SEE WAS BORN!  
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>I'm still not 100% satisfied with how it looks,
                                but this time I did more research on some styling techniques, and I think its much better for it.
                                Additionally I took my time a bit more in dealing with positioning and styling.  I feel like I have
                                a much better grasp of how relative positioning works, and how to write good, reusable CSS classes.
                                I'm sure I'll keep making changes here over time, but for now I'm satisfied with it as a portfolio
                                site.
