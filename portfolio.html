                            <p>This website is in fact a project! Pretty sure that counts.  I've had websites before, but 
                                I tried to do it a little differently this time.  First time around was pure HTML and CSS, but 
                                I wasn't satisfied enough with how it looked to keep it, looked a little too ameteurish. Next 
                                was in wordpress, which felt like cheating but eh, it worked for a while.  Once I decided to try
                                and learn more Front-End, WHAT YOU SEE WAS BORN!  
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>I'm still not 100% satisfied with how it looks,
                                but this time I did more research on some styling techniques, and I think its much better for it.
                                Additionally I took my time a bit more in dealing with positioning and styling.  I feel like I have
                                a much better grasp of how relative positioning works, and how to write good, reusable CSS classes.
                                I'm sure I'll keep making changes here over time, but for now I'm satisfied with it as a portfolio
                                site.

                            <p>Speckle is where I'm currently working.  We're working to create platform to help people learn public 
                                speaking. Rather than just teaching people how to speak though, we're doing things differently by helping
                                people help each other.  The system revolves around people recoring themselves, getting an automatic rating 
                                from us, but also encouraging them to share their videos to others, and have them rate each other, and follow
                                each other to progress as a group.

                                As for my own contribution, I bounced between working on backend infrastructure with AWS, and workign with
                                frontend web portals.  I spent a lot of time working on our DynamoDB tables and related API, allowing for 
                                proper manipulation.  Also created plenty of lambda functions for data maniuplation as well as basic searching,
                                using it for features like getting most viewed videos, featured videos, and featured creators.  This basic search 
                                functionality was temporary before I got our elasticsearch implementation going, with queries to get related information.

                                Frontend work has so far has been less of a priority for me, but I did create web portals to give data manipulation
                                abilities to our non-technical workers. Prior to this if they wanted to upload videos for testing, they would have to
                                go through us, to have us put it into the table manually. Now the page allows for video uploads and uses Javascript
                                to query lambda functions and upload through there.

                                implementation, and there I've been able to.
